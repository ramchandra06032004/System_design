//  in above code problem is that we have to create a new class for every combination of toppings. and in industry level code this is not feasible to scale.
// // Solution is to use Decorator Pattern.
// // Decorator Pattern allows us to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.
// // It is achieved by creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.
// // This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality.
// // The decorator pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
// // The decorator pattern is typically used to extend the functionalities of classes in a flexible and reusable way.
